BMAD commands

Place helper command files here for interactive use by CLAUDE/agents.

Examples:
- `init.md` — prompts and steps to create `bmad/config.yaml` and `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`

This folder is intentionally minimal; add command templates if you want automated entrypoints for `bmad-master` workflows.
