1. **Project Initialization**:
    - The constructor sets up the project using the `tsconfig` file and configures paths and ignore patterns.

2. **File Analysis**:
    - The `analyzeFile` method checks for cached results.
    - It differentiates between Svelte files and other files.
    - For Svelte files, it delegates to `analyzeSvelteFile`.
    - For other files, it retrieves or adds the source file to the project.
    - It resolves imported types and extracts metadata.
    - Results are cached and returned.

3. **Svelte File Analysis**:
    - The `analyzeSvelteFile` method reads the Svelte file content.
    - It extracts and analyzes the TypeScript script content.
    - It resolves imported types and extracts metadata.
    - Results are cached and returned.

4. **Directory Analysis**:
    - The `analyzeDirectory` method resolves the directory path.
    - It lists files using a glob pattern and analyzes each file.
    - Results are returned.

5. **Metadata Extraction**:
    - The `extractMetadata` method traverses the source file nodes.
    - It extracts types, comments, and JSDoc.
    - It specifically extracts types like `actions` and `ExampleProps`.

6. **Imported Types Resolution**:
    - The `resolveImportedTypes` method traverses import declarations.
    - It analyzes imported modules and adds resolved types to the results.

7. **Specific Types Extraction**:
    - The `extractTypeForType` method finds and extracts specified types by traversing descendant nodes.
