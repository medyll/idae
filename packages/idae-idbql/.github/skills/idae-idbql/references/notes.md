# Notes

- All methods are type-safe and support TypeScript generics.
- Query operators ($gt, $in, $or, etc.) are supported via @medyll/idae-query.
- For reactivity, use Svelte 5 runes or idae-stator as described in the main documentation.
- Deprecated methods (getOne, del) are included for backward compatibility.
