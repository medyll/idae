# Step 7: Initialisation of dataModel and dbSchema

These modules define the main data model types and an example schema, as described in README.md.

## Purpose
- Declare CollectionTemplate and SchemeModelDb types
- Provide an example schema for the 'agents' collection

## Structure
- dataModel.ts: types for collections and schema
- dbSchema.ts: example schema using parseFieldRule

## Next steps
- Extend schema for more collections
- Integrate with UI and CRUD logic
