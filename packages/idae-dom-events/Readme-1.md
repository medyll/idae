1. Introduction

dom-events is a TypeScript library designed to simplify the use of the MutationObserver API, making manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) more intuitive and suitable for different use cases. This library is particularly useful for web applications that require dynamic DOM management, such as tracking attribute changes, observing changes in the child list of an element, and detecting character data changes.

1.1 Overview of the dom-events Library

dom-events revolves around two key components: the htmlu class and the HtmluDomLib class. htmlu is the main class used to interact with the API, while HtmluDomLib, a singleton, manages the observable elements and provides methods like storeObservable to store these elements.

1.2 Context and Objectives of dom-events

The dom-events initiative was born out of the need to make the MutationObserver API more accessible to developers. By encapsulating the complexity of this API and optimizing event handling, dom-events aims to facilitate monitoring and manipulation of DOM changes.

1.3 Typical Use Cases of dom-events

The versatility of dom-events allows it to be used in a wide range of web applications, from simple to complex. It is ideal for situations where dynamic DOM monitoring is required, such as tracking attribute changes, observing changes in the child list of an element, or detecting character data changes.

This revised version aims to maintain clarity and conciseness while providing all the necessary information about dom-events.
